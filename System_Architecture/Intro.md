## Architecture
Architecture is about the important stuff, whatever that stuff is.
- Focus on structure
- Anticipate expensive choices
- Core decision for high quality

## What should the system do?
- This is known as the **functional requirements**.

## How should the system behave?
- This is known as the **non-functional requirements.**
	-  This include things like Maintainability, scalability, reliability, short response latency(efficiency)
## We might also have some sort of restrictions.
- This might include laws and rules that we might need to adhere to.

## Portability.
- If the system is going to be ported around, then this needs to considered in the design too.
