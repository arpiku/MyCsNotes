##### The philosophy 
- Every software system provides two different values to the stakeholders, **behaviour** and **structure**.
- Software engineers tend to focus their efforts on the less important one way too much.


# Behaviour
- We need to make the machines do what we want them them to do, i.e the behaviour.
- If something doesn't work properly you fix the bug and call it a day.
**- But software engineering is more than that.**

## Architecture.
- "*Soft*" in software (*ware* being product), stands for the ability to change it easily, if it is hard to change then why not just call it hardware as well.
- This is the same issue as discussed before with the executive vs. engineers. The executive are concerned about the behavoir but a bad architecute means that overtime their demand for new product will be similar to fitting round shape into a square hole.

## Understanding
- *If you give me a program that works perfectly but is impossible to change, then it won't work when the requirements change, and I won't be able to make it work. Therefore the program will become useless.*
- *If you give me a program that does not work but is easy to change, then I can make it work, and keep it working as requirements change. Therefore the program will remain continually useful.*

*"I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent"*
