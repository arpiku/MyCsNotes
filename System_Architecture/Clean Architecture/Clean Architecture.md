- [Robert C. Marthin]
Software architecture is a metaphor, the things that seem obvious when using the word architecute are not something that apply directly to software
"Enterprise Soviet schemes designed for legacy, imporbable Jenga towers reaching toward the cloud, archeoglogical layers buried in a big ball of mud slide"
> Rober C. Martin

When we talk about software architecture things are a lot more connected, recursive, fractal in nature, etched and sketched in code, everything in detail. Interlocking levels.

Software architecture does not look like anything, a particular visualization is a choise not a given.

However software is limited in physical sense by the hardware it's running on.

"*This is the montrosity in love, lady, that the will in infinite, and the execution confined, that the desire is boundless, and the act a slave to limit*" 
> William Shakespeare

Architecture is importatn for somethign like the effor in monetry and people terms invested in it.
> "*If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture.*"
> Brian Foote and Joeseph Yoder.

"The code just hasn't changes that much, that is the secret."
The eludes to the fact that whether it be PDP-8 or Mac Pro running M2 pro ultra, the basic logic of code remains all the same.
