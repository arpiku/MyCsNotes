## Pointers:
- It is the ability to create ***falsifiable*** units of programming that makes structured programming valuable today. This is the reason that modern language do not typically support unrestrained `goto` statements. Moreover, at the architectural level, this is why we still consider *funtional decomposition* to be one our best practices.
- At every level, from the smallest function to the largest component, software is like a science and, therefore, is driven by falsifiability. Software architects strive to define modules, components, and services that are easily falsifiable(testable). To do so, they employ restrictive disciplines similar to structured programming, albeit at a much higer level.
