*Getting software right is hard, It takes knowledge and skills that most young programmers haven't yet acquired. It requires thought and insight that most programmers don't take time to develop. It requires a level of discipline and dedication that most programmers never dreamed they'd need. Mostly it takes a passion for the craft and the desire to be a professional*

# What is Design And Architecture
#design #softwareArchitecture 

They are one and the same, just semantics. The main idea isnt' that different from conventional architecute, yet people seem to forget that, an artchitect's drwaing doesn't just contain the outer shots and sizes of the building, but havge enough low level details to make the entire thing make sense. Software engineers seem overlook that, choosing abtractions that actually hide those details and hence seemingly reasonable architecutre can be bad interanally.


### What is the goal?
"*The goal of software architecutre is to minmize the human resources required to build and maintain the requried system*"

### Executive vs. Engineers
- The executive wants things fast
- This leads to systems thrown together with low considerations to architecture.
- What is inevitable is increased cost of software maintenance that will come back to bite both engineers and executives. 
- Executives will be annoyed as less modifiable code means features cannont be developed fast enough, while the cost of maintaining the code increases.
- While on the other side the engineers have to face scrutiny for not being able to deliver on time, due to the mess that is their code base.

#### The hare and the turtle, the story by Aesop (2600 Yrs ago)
- "*Slow and steady wins the race.*"
- "*The race is not to the swift, not the battle to the strong.*"
- "*The more haste, the less speed.*"

### The lie of a developer:
- We can clean it up later; we just have to get to market first!

"*The only way to go fast, is to go well*"

## Is starting from scractch the answer?
- NO
*- The **overconfidence** will drive the redesign into the same mess as the original project.***


#### Pointers:
- In everycase, the best option for a dev. org. is to recognize and avoid it's own overconfidence and to start taking the quality of its software architecture seriously.
- To do so, one needs to know what good software architecture is.
