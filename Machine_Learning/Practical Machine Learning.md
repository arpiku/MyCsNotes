## Decomposition 
- To make sense of unsupervised problems we can user something called **Decomposition Techniques**, these techniques decompose the data to a lower dimensionality, that is still enough to represent the required data.
- Ex. [[Principal Component Analysis]], [[t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding t-SNE]] etc.

- Supervised problems are easy to tackle as they are easier to evaluate, most of the time it is possible to convert a supervised dataset to unsupervised dataset and see how they look like when plotted.
