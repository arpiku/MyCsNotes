What does it take?
What are the sequences and events that need to happen in correct order to serve a video to you?
How much knowledge has been used to solve just that problem?
Can human effort be divided into categories where investment on one thing has resulted in betterment of some measurable metric using the internet?
Can a value be assingned to each of our actions, in the sense that if somehow I do something good then a score gets associated with it? The score is not calculated by you but by the effect had on the lives of people around you? That score are the modern likes and the modern system of commentry, it is insanlly hard to distinguish what is genuine and what is not? How does the intention different from two intention, if I do good for you, and you feel better but I did that as an investment and not true nature of favour.
Values are different. They are more malleable than we have given them credit for, the thoughts that seem stable today are just as instantanious as time itself. We feel more than the last generation, indeed we do, we know that a large part of population is not part of "US". What is this us? Who knows for some it's the young teenagers who don't care whethere two people of gender sleep together, or this is the "US" that genuinly feels that their skin colour has anything to do with their competence or importance in existence. We take too much to be fruit of our labour and feel burdened about our failures that weren't us. This us is just going to change what we need to make sure as a society is that they do think different than us, there is not point of a single philsophy it should evolve with time, and the ideas that you felt are crucial to existence of humanity itself will taken as heresy, Times change and it's our responsibilty to let the next team have it, if we disagree we can talk about it, but is the other group that bad? Sometimes it is! Any group that thretens the identity of an other one is most definetly wrong, but that statement is not correct, if I don't support the oppresion, the murder, the pain in this nation and I am ready to support my nation to go at war this other .. I don't know dicatorship, this oppresive regime in this nation, what a few 100 million suffering, not being able to eat, sleep, but us billions we have food, but look at those fuckers they have so much ohhhh they are going to destroy this planet, we must stop these "greedy" people, to "huh.... these little fuckers don't even know how much we are trying to do for , them all they seem to is complain , do they even know how much I sacrificed for them!". All of these ideas are in opposition, when all of them are fighting the same game, they just pretent it's somehow different, all of us have our stories, some are like fiction that inspire us, others are like nighmares that we are trying to run away from, we create this ficitonal worlds that we enjoy, these worlds that we want to be part, these worlds where these people exist where somehow human existence is more prevelant, all of these animated worlds are about the life we want to live, we want to experience. And we tell us ourselves about it, sometimes these worlds take a shape to fight the acceptance as society that we have grown past a phase, racism is something we talk about the monsters that we have fought, they are guidance towards a better future. Just like stories inspired, the our ancients, taught them about the dangers around, or talked about the places to go for food, to newspapers to let us know how this expanding group is doing? We have constantly been on watch for each other. Everything we have built is now communication around where we couldn't before. And these devices has expanded our ability to absorb and have better understanding of the mind state of the people around me, which then puts me at place to judge my own morals, here I mean how we publicaly shame the people who have messed up, who pretended to be part of our thought group but wansn't.  Every media evolve towards stating the state of things every day, every hour, every second. It just keeps growing, however many interaction a human makes per day should increase. For it used to be inernet didn't exist, it was just few machines passing weird bouncy signals around. How many people are there, and how the number of interaction done by a human increased every decade.
