- "j" stands for joining.
In C++20, the Standard Library introduced the `std::jthread` class, which is an improvement over the traditional `std::thread` class for managing threads. The key difference between `std::jthread` and `std::thread` is that `std::jthread` provides better exception safety by automatically joining or detaching the thread when it goes out of scope, making it safer and more convenient for managing threads.

Here's a simple example that demonstrates the difference between `std::jthread` and `std::thread`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

void threadFunction() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; ++i) {
        std::cout << "Thread ID: " << std::this_thread::get_id() << " - Count: " << i << std::endl;
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));
    }
}

int main() {
    std::cout << "Using std::thread:" << std::endl;

    std::thread t1(threadFunction);
    // t1 needs to be explicitly joined or detached
    t1.join(); // or t1.detach()

    std::cout << "Using std::jthread:" << std::endl;

    std::jthread jt1(threadFunction); // Automatically joins or detaches when jt1 goes out of scope

    // The std::jthread doesn't need to be explicitly joined or detached

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we have a function `threadFunction` that is executed by both `std::thread` and `std::jthread`. The key difference is in how the threads are managed:

1. When using `std::thread`, you need to explicitly call `join()` or `detach()` on the thread object (`t1` in this case) to either wait for the thread to finish (`join()`) or detach it, allowing it to run independently (`detach()`). Failing to join or detach a `std::thread` before it goes out of scope leads to a program termination.

2. With `std::jthread`, the thread is automatically joined when the `std::jthread` object (`jt1` in this case) goes out of scope. This automatic management of the thread's lifecycle provides better exception safety.

In summary, `std::jthread` is a safer and more convenient choice when managing threads in C++20 and later, as it reduces the chances of resource leaks and simplifies thread management compared to `std::thread`.
