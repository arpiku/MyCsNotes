_Resource Acquisition Is Initialization_ or RAII, is a C++ programming technique[[1]](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii#cite_note-2) which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connectionâ€”anything that exists in limited supply) to the [lifetime](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/lifetime "cpp/language/lifetime") of an object.
