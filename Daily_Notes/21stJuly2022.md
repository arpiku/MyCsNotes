## JavaScript vs PHP
- LAMP - [[Linux_GNU]], Apache, MySql, PHP.
- [[Ajax]] - Asynchronous JS and XML : This just refers to a technique to send and receive data in the background of a webpage without refresh. This is usually done using XMLhttprequest, the request sends the relevant information to get the correct data, and the server retrurns the JS obeject meeting those requirements.

## HTML, XML, and SGML
- It all started with a lawyer dude in 1970s called Charles Goldfarb, thought it'd be a good idea to insert tags into documents to give them some sort of structure.
- It was just to make things easier to find.

- ![[SGML_Demo.jpg]]
-  The '/Q' refers to quote, the interesting part is that because we are crawling on the inforamtion and are looking at the tags we can automate the style based on the said tags.
- End of body was 'omit-able ', the reason was disk space.
- SGML is more like punctuation. Memo is application of SGML, it uses the tech of SGML, SGML is meta-notation , Memo is a specific tag set. 
- SGML had document type defination that would define what tags are legal and what are actually optional, CS people didn't like the idea of omit-able tags.
- SGML - Standerdised Generalized Markup langugage
- XML - Extensible Markup langugagte
- HTML - Hypertext Markup langugage
- HTML first faced issues because while it had been an adaption of SGML for the interenet era, it still lacked some fundamental tags that were needed to be added, as there was no authority on to what should be the way to do it, both I.E and Netscape went their own routes, creating a biforcation of HTML implementation and use.
- They had different emittablity specification.
- DTD - Document Type defination was not there and well people started coding.
- It was a massive issue between the SGML priests and the actual developers and browsers who were creating the internet:
	- The issues were as follows:
	- Overlapping hierarchies .
	- Ability to omit end tags.
	- Not defined DTD.
	- The solution that the SGML guys proposed included creating something that resembled compiled language rather than a interpreted language and infact not show anything of the webpage or 'an error' if say an end tag was missing.
- This leads to a dicsussion between two guys Brailsford and Tim-Berners Lee, and XML was born as subset of SMGL but with a really good DTD.

### Auth0

### NestJS
- NodeJS framework for scalable server side application with TS.
- Supports Rest and GraphQL apis out of the box.
- ![[ModeViewControl.jpg]]
- Similar to Larbels or Ruby on rails.
- **Provider** : a class that contains shared logic through out the entire application and can be injected as a dependency wherever needed.
- A class with '@Injectable' decorator can be injected into the constructor of another obejct.
- We also have '@Module' operator that allows lazy loading and run faster in server less env.
- A **Provider** can be implemented as guard for role based user authentication. 
- Or as a pipe to effectively take and transform values as required.

### TypeScript
- Behaves like a compiled langugage, it handles the situtaion where a fucntion or undeclerared varibale is being used.
- It is a strict superset of JS.
- tsconfig.json can be used to completely customize the behaviour of the compiler.
- ![[Tsconfig.jpg]]
- It will either implicitly understand the type of the variable when we intialize it with some value, or we can strongly type the data type of the variable.

### SASS - Syntactically Awesome StyleSheet
- No semi-clons and curly braces in .sass file.
- The superset .scss files allows you to write vanilla css with SASS features.
- Allows nesting, prevents duplication, allows morphsim for the style code-blocks.
- Also have logics like functions, if-else, returns, arrays etc.



### JavaScript
- Everything after the => function is automatically assumed to be the return value of the function, it is equivalent to creating function pointers, and callable functions using a 'label' for the function.
- When we a single parameter being passed we can even remove the '()' :
- There is no '*arguments*' variable
- '*this*' is not usable as int the similar way.
- '*this'* is not the same because in normal function 'this' gets redefined depending on the scope in which the function is being called, while in  the case of arrow function the scope is defined only to the function body.
![[ScopeArrowJS.jpg]]
- '*call()'* and '*apply()*'  are also not usable.
```JS
function sum(a,b) {
return a + b
}

// Is same as 

let sum = (a,b) => {
return a + b
}

//Which is same as 

let sum = (a,b) => a+b

//Also

function sqr(a) {
return a*a
}

//is same as 

let sqr = a => a*a


//also

let randNum = () => Math.random // Yup this is the one for no parameter function.
```
- **Lambdas**  : This is really important for a programming language to support **first-class functions** which basically means **passing functions as arguments to other functions or assigning them to variables.**
- 'Promises' are meant to replace callBacks
