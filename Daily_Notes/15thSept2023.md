### Problem with UUID.
- The error occured when directly trying to insert a field with UUID as the datatype in MongoDB.
``` 
ValueError: cannot encode native uuid.UUID with UuidRepresentation.UNSPECIFIED. UUIDs can be manually converted to bson.Binary instances using bson.Binary.from_uuid() or a different UuidRepresentation can be configured. See the documentation for UuidRepresentation for more information.
```

- This can be resolved using the following code
```python
document["anonId"] = bson.Binary.from_uuid(document["anonId"])
```
