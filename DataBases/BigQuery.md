## BigQuery
1. Enterprise data warehouse, make analytics available for everyone.
2. Designed to handle very large datasets, fully managed server less data warehouse.
3. This avoid having data silos, where independent teams have different data marts.
4. Using IAM, we can assign read and write permission to different individuals securely.
5. BQ is fully managed, no database administrator required.
6. It used SQL to store data.
7. All the scaling is managed by google.
8. There are pre built ingestion pipelines that can take data from cloud storage (like aws s3), from google services like(firebase, cloud dataflow, cloud appengine), or perhaps simply upload using csv and json files.
9. There are public datasets that can be used to learn how BigQuery works.
