# Component Specs:
- CPU: Base clock (3.5-4 GHz), at least 8 cores, from the current or last generation of AMD or Intel line up.
	- SolidWorks and simulation software prefer multicore processors and higher frequencies are important for quick rending of files.
- RAM: At least 32 GB ram, speed should be at least 3200 MT/s
	- Required for smoother operations when large models are inserted into memory.
- Hard drive: At least 1 TB NVME boot drive, 2 TB Fast Hard Drive.
	- The CAD files and rendering outputs can get extremely large.
- MotherBoard : Full size ATX, with multiple PCI Gen 4 slots with good VRMs.
	- The motherboard should have extra empty slots for future upgradations. 
- Power supply: 850 W at least 80+ gold rated.
	- Bad or low wattage Power Supply may lead to software crashes if the power peaks during some computation and the system is not able to handle it.
- GPU: Should be at least an RTX 3070 
	- Need the GPU for faster simulation and rending outputs.
- CPU Cooler: 
	- Just make sure the TDP of processor can be handled by the cooler.

The above image shows a product that meet the requirements please meet them as closely or if something better is available at a reasonable price then that.

## Monitor
- Would prefer a least 27 inch 1440p for easy multitasking.
