- We don't know how many segments actually make sense
- ~~Do we have visits equivalent or activeDays should be used for frequency?
	- We do not have visit equivalent, so activeDays.

## Options:

### Two Dimension grid
- The buckets will be hardcoded.
- The rectangles will just have the total number of people w.r.t to the buckets.

## Single Score
- Standard deviation will be used to give all the user a singular score.
- The users then can be divided into n buckets as required.

## Triangle
- Not valiable for our case.
